# dice-generator

The Program is quite simple.

The program uses html, css, bootstrap and javascript.

Html, is the structure where I will make the form. 

CSS, will be used for styling of the content and bootstrap wil be used for a container with a grid layout, which will contain the form.

Javascript will be used for functionality of the program like taking a value from the form and generating a random number.

The user will be asked how many sided dice will be used to generate a random nuber from the dice, and the program will generate a random number for a dice. This eill be similar to rolling a dice.
